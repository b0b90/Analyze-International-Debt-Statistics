International Debt Statistics Analysis

Project Description

This GitHub repository contains an analysis of international debt statistics collected by The World Bank. It explores the debt owed by developing countries across various categories. 

The analysis aims to answer questions such as:

- What is the total amount of debt owed by the countries listed in the dataset?
- Which country owns the maximum amount of debt, and what is that amount?
- What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?

The dataset used in this project is provided by The World Bank and includes national and regional debt statistics for multiple countries, recorded from 1970 to 2015.

Project Tasks

The analysis is divided into the following tasks:

- The World Bank's international debt data connection: Establishing a connection to The World Bank's international debt dataset.

- Finding the number of distinct countries: Identifying and counting the distinct countries included in the dataset.

- Finding out the distinct debt indicators: Identifying the various debt indicators used in the dataset.

- Totaling the amount of debt owed by the countries: Calculating the total amount of debt owed by all countries in the dataset.

- Country with the highest debt: Determining the country that owns the highest amount of debt and the corresponding amount.

- Average amount of debt across indicators: Calculating the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators.

- The highest amount of principal repayments: Identifying the highest amount of principal repayments made by any country.

- The most common debt indicator: Identifying the most frequently used debt indicator in the dataset.

- Other viable debt issues and conclusion: Addressing any other relevant debt-related issues discovered during the analysis and summarizing the findings.
